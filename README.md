# Python Daily Practice

This repository documents my daily Python learning journey starting from the basics.

## Goal
- Learn Python fundamentals properly
- Build consistency with daily coding
- Track progress publicly using GitHub

## Progress
- Day 1: Variables, input/output, basic arithmetic
- Day 2: Conditional statements – if, elif, else


I will update this repository daily with small Python programs and notes.
