# Student Performance Analysis – Pandas Mini Project

## Overview
This project analyzes student marks using Pandas to calculate totals, averages, grades, and identify top and failing students.

The goal was to apply Pandas concepts end-to-end on a realistic dataset.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains:
- Student names
- Marks in Maths, Science, and English

Each row represents one student.

---

## Steps Performed

### 1. Data Creation
- Created a DataFrame manually using a dictionary
- Ensured consistent column names and numeric values

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Calculated total marks per student
- Computed average marks
- Assigned grades based on average scores

### 3. Analysis
- Identified the top performer using total marks
- Calculated subject-wise averages
- Detected students who failed in any subject

### 4. Refactoring
- Moved logic into functions
- Reduced repetition
- Improved readability and structure

---

## Key Learnings
- Pandas allows complex analysis without loops
- Clean column naming improves clarity
- Refactoring makes code easier to maintain
- Explaining code reveals gaps in understanding

---

## Possible Improvements
- Load data from CSV instead of hardcoding
- Add visualizations
- Handle larger datasets
