# Day 27: Reflection and Next Steps
#
# What I achieved in 27 days:
# - Learned Python fundamentals from scratch
# - Built a daily coding habit
# - Understood logic, not just syntax
# - Used GitHub regularly with meaningful commits
#
# Topics I am now comfortable with:
# - Variables, conditions, loops
# - Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
# - Functions and basic problem solving
# - File handling and exception handling
# - Basic OOP concepts (classes, objects, inheritance)
#
# My weak areas (to improve next):
# - Speed in problem solving
# - Writing cleaner functions
# - Thinking edge cases faster
